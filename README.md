# Internet Applications Design and Implementation (2024 Edition)

This course focuses on the principles and concepts on the development of Internet applications. The syllabus follows an approach based on the fundamentals of software development based on web and service oriented architectural patterns, advanced modularity mechanisms, data persistency abstractions, good development practices, performance concerns, and validation techniques. Course lectures are accompanied by a series of practical assignments and a final project development using frameworks, languages, and programming tools for Internet Applications that ensure the safety and compliance of the solution with relation to a specification.
